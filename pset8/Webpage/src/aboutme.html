      <p class="card-text">Hi. My name is Timon Wong. I am a Malaysian-Chinese based in Singapore. I fly around the world as a Flight Crew...
         or so I used to, until the recent pandemic hit, and of course it hit the aviation industry especially hard.
         As of writing this, the airlines across the globe are still trying to climb out of this financial slump
         <br><br>
         Fortunately, like all things in life, there's usually a silver lining to every situation and undoubtedly
         this time granted me a substantial opportunity to explore various things outside of work.
         Since young, I have always had interest in developing technology and getting my hands on new gadgets.
         Back in high school, I was the President of my school's Computer Club and taught myself C and C++.
         As such, I've decided to continue my path towards my passion and upon hours of my research, I have gathered a great
         deal of Online Courses avilable on the web. But one struck out to me the most, and it's none other than the popular
         Harvard University's edX Online Courses.
         <br><br>
         I am currently enrolled onto Harvard University's edX CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by Prof. David Malan.
         This particular project is a kill-two-birds-with-one-rock kind of situation for me. You see, I've always been
         quite an avid in buidling Raspberry Pi projects, and had ideas to document it on a website that I've built myself.
         As such, for the Web Track of CS50, I am creating this website as a prototype/practice for my upcoming project website.
         For those who are wondering, the name A Piece Of Pi is a play on words,  derrived from the recurring saying of "a piece of cake",
         signifying a relative simple task, which is the exact idea and philosophy, of which my Raspberry Pi projects are built upon.
         I beleive DIY projects should be extremely simple, relatively cheap and uncomplicated to build I've seen many projects & "tutorials" online,
         a fair portion of them are extremely non-beginner friendly and does a poor job of explaining the thought process behind it.
         Hence, stick around with me and let's build some projects!
